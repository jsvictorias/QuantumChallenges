# ⚛️ Quantum Challenges ⚛️
Some challenges and exercises using the bases of quantum computing.

## What are this challenges?

This challenges is exercises using the basis of quantum computing, most of this exercises were made available by my quantum computer teacher and some I get from [*"Quantum Learning"*](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/) platform from IBM.

## How are they organized? 

Each challenge will be separeted in a folder, with the "name" of the challenge. This folder will contain the README file explaining what is the point of the exercise and what I learned doing it. And then, it will have the main file, with the code. 

I'm using python with jupyter, so in the main file it will have the `.ipynb` extension.

## How to run on my computer ?

### My first time with the code, what about now??
if it is your **first time** accessing the code, it's recommended to create an virtual enviroment with the code: 

 * `python -m venv env`

Then you can activate the venv:
* `env/scripts/activate`

(If shows up any question, just press "A" in terminal)

After this, you can do the pip installs for the quantum enviroment:
* `pip install qiskit` 
* `pip install jupyter` (if you don´t have)
* `pip intall qiskit_aer`

Maybe you'll have to upgrade your pip, if that's the case, run the following code:
* `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

### I already have all this installed, do I have to run theses commands?

No! If your enviroment it's ok, you can just run:
* `env/scripts/activate`

and run my answears to the challenges, try it yourself and have fun ✌︎︎.
