# Eight Tree Challenge â”€â”€â”€ â‹†â‹…â˜†â‹…â‹† â”€â”€

### In this challenge we will separate a set of trees and give back the number of the trees in binary (if the set of trees is pair, return 0 or if it is odd, return 1). ðŸ’»

It will be given four vectors, containing a set of number (0 or 1), the 1's will represent the trees, and if there is a sequence of 1's, it means is one set of tree. The 0's is suposed to break the set. The point is to return how many set of trees there is in a vector.

* Example:

[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1] â†’ 1

> What is the point of this exercise?
> * Learn how to use vector with quantum circuits
> * Understand how the vectors and arrays are usefull for quantum circuits
