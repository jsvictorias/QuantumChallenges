# New Match Challenge â”€â”€â”€ â‹†â‹…â˜†â‹…â‹† â”€â”€

### interferometer is an instrument in which the interference of two beams of light is employed to make precise measurements. The purpose of this challenge is for you to make your interferometer.ðŸ’»

There's a generalization of an interferometer with two half-silvered mirrors. A half-silvered mirror is a device that reflects half of the incident light, letting the other half pass through it unaffected.

After being divided by the semi-silvered mirror, the wave beams begin to follow different paths and may encounter phase shifters, which consist of devices that allow the wave phase (or phase modulators) to be changed in the desired way.

Next, the wave beams pass again through a semi-silvered mirror, to finally reach the screen, which denotes the wave intensity detectors at the possible outputs of the interferometer. 

Your task is to implement an interferometer like the one shown below, with a phase shifter that depends on `r`
