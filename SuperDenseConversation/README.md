### In this challenge we will simulate the intertwining using quantum computing. ðŸ’»

Alice and Bob are two friends, Bob wants to send a super important message do Alice: "quantic is cool". To send this message super important in a very quick way, Bob decide to send it by using intertwining quantum. To do that, it's necessary to **first** entangle the Bob's qubit with Alice's qubit and then, do the appropriate circuit to send the binary's values of the message. 

Alice will receive this qubits, measure them and keep them in a vector. After this, she'll decode the message and finally read the super important message Bob wanted to tell her.
